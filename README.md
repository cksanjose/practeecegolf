# Practeecegolf

This application is to help golfers practice successfully using various scenarios that they may encounter in the golf course.
The aim of this project is practice like musicians. Instead of mindlessly swinging a golf club multiple times, the golfer 
will use different golf clubs and strategies in various situations.

This is a progressive web application built using Angular 6 and Angular Material.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## To debug service work, use http-server. (ng serve doesn't support service worker)
    * Download install http-server (npm install http-server -g) 
    * Open terminal/command window. Change working directory to dist/practeecegolf.
    * Run "http-server -p4600" to serve from port 4600.
    * Open the web browser and go to: http://localhost:4600 

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
